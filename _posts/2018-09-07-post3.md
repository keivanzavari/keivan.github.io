## Foreword 

This post describes what I went through to install jekyll on *Ubuntu 14.04*. So if you are using another version of Ubuntu or a different OS, some steps might not apply to your case.


### 1- via ruby-install

1. First install the *ruby-install*

    ```bash
    wget -O ruby-install-0.7.0.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.7.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.7.0.tar.gz
    cd ruby-install-0.7.0/
    sudo make install
    ```

    Please refer to [ruby install readme][1] for more information.

2. then install a ruby (version higher than 2)

    ```bash
    ruby-install --system ruby --latest
    ```


### 2- via PPA
Alternatively, use a ppa like this one. 

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ruby2.5 ruby2.5-dev
```
there is a risk that the right binary packages are not available for your linux distribution. I am running this on Trusty which is Ubuntu 14.04.

### 3- install via source
- [download][3] and install ruby from source

- compile and install

    ```bash
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

- update gem: `sudo gem update --system`

### 4- install jekyll


install jekyll as described on its [homepage][2] (if you compiled from source, this is not required)

```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
and install jekyll as

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## use jekyll

jekyll is quite nicely documented on [its website][4] and there are a lot of [examples and themes][5] available online.
